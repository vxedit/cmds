If Linux Mint is rejecting your password after merging the `/home` partition with the root partition, it may be due to user-related files in `/home` being inaccessible or missing. Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **Step 1: Boot into a Live Linux Environment**
1. Use your bootable Linux USB to boot into a live session.
2. Open a terminal to investigate and fix the issue.

---

### **Step 2: Mount the Root Partition**
1. Identify the root partition using:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
2. Mount the root partition:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXn /mnt
   ```
   Replace `/dev/sdXn` with your root partition's identifier.

---

### **Step 3: Check User Directories in `/home`**
1. Navigate to the `/home` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/home
   ls
   ```
   Ensure the directory corresponding to your username exists.
   
2. If it's missing, recreate it:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/home/your-username
   sudo chown your-username:your-username /mnt/home/your-username
   chmod 700 /mnt/home/your-username
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Reset User Password**
1. Chroot into your system:
   ```bash
   sudo chroot /mnt
   ```
2. Reset your user password:
   ```bash
   passwd your-username
   ```
3. Exit the chroot environment:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Update Permissions**
Ensure the `/home` directory has the correct permissions:
```bash
sudo chmod 755 /mnt/home
```

---

### **Step 6: Check and Reinstall Display Manager**
1. Verify that your display manager (e.g., LightDM) is installed and working:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install --reinstall lightdm
   ```
2. If needed, reconfigure it:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
   ```

---

### **Step 7: Reboot the System**
Unmount the root partition and reboot:
```bash
sudo umount /mnt
reboot
```

---

### **Step 8: Test Login**
After rebooting, try logging in with your reset password.

---

### **If Issues Persist**
1. **Check Logs**: Boot into recovery mode and review the logs for login-related errors:
   ```bash
   journalctl -xe
   ```
2. **Revert Changes**: If everything fails, consider restoring from a backup or reinstalling the system while preserving data in `/home`.
